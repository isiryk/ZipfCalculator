This project is more or less about me strengthening my skillset in C++.

Description:
  I recently watched a VSauce video on the Zipf Mystery (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE)
  The short end of it is that the Zipf mystery states we as people are very pattern oriented. Where
  if we write a piece of text, each word we use will fit into the Zipf curve.

  Example:
    If I wrote a book, the word "the" may appear roughly 1/2 of the time. The next word in frequency
    would appear a 1/3 as much as the total, the next 1/4, and so on and so forth.

Implementation:
  I will be using C++ to implement this. What I will do is take in a piece of user text specified
  during program launch. Go through all of the words and then rank them according to their frequency
  and print out a file with the sorted list.
